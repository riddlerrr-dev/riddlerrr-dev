Hey!👋 I’m Alex aka **Riddlerrr**

I write code, break things, fix them again, and somehow end up with working projects.  
Usually Python or Go — sometimes web automation, sometimes bots, sometimes full-on madness.  

Built stuff like:
- 🎮 **Game server automation** (CS:GO servers, auto-config + log reporting)
- 🤖 **Twitch & Discord bots** with dynamic commands and data tracking
- ⚡ **High-performance API middleware** written in Go or Python
- 🧠 **Game optimisation tools** using dynamic programming (*Once Human*)

If it can be automated, I’ll make it happen.  
Code, caffeine, and chaos — in roughly that order. ☕⚙️
